Webpage for my custom cables

This is a work in progress for my storefront. I intend to make it more complex as i develop my skills in css, bootstrap, sass/scss, and javascript. My goal is to eventually use this site to sell my computer services. 

Planned updates:
  *Functioning cart system
  *Animated designs throughout the site
  *Database integration to auto-update current inventory
  *Email integration for support and inquiries
  *More fluid and responsive designs as I learn best practices
