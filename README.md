**Webpage for my custom cables**

This is a work in progress for my storefront. I intend to make it more complex as i develop my skills in css, bootstrap, sass/scss, and javascript. My goal is to eventually use this site to sell my computer services. I'm looking to redesign this site with React or another framework at a later date. This project has served as a refresher in web design and a learning experience for new features i had not implemented before.

**Planned updates:**
- Functioning cart system
- Animated designs throughout the site
- Database integration to auto-update current inventory
- Email integration for support and inquiries
- More fluid and responsive designs as I learn best practices


**Features(as required by codekentucky)**
- 2 media queries.
- Menu navigation changes upon resizing browser.
- Image galleries implemented through javascript(Second image gallery is buggy. The navigation arrows will cause the image to not display, but can be resolved if you use the dots below the gallery)
- Dropdown menu implemented through javascript(When closed the navigation on the full size layout will disappear. I have not been able to resolve this. Recommended fix has been to add two separate navigations).
- Multiple different css animations.
- n-th child selector used in dropdown menu to style the link colors.
